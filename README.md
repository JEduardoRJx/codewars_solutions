## Intro
My solutions to Katas via Codewars using different languages.
Katas are code challenges focused on improving skill and technique.

## What is Codewars?
Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train 
on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each 
other get better through practice.
